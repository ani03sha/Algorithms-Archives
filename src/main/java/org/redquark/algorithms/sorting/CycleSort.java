/**

 * <p>
 * Cycle sort is an in-place sorting Algorithm, unstable sorting algorithms,
 * a comparison sort that is theoretically optimal in terms of the total number of writes to the original array.
 * <p>
 * - It is optimal in terms of number of memory writes. It minimizes the number of memory writes to sort
 * (Each value is either written zero times, if itâ€™s already in its correct position, or written one time
 * to its correct position.)
 * <p>
 * - It is based on the idea that array to be sorted can be divided into cycles.
 * Cycles can be visualized as a graph. We have n nodes and an edge directed from node i to node j
 * if the element at i-th index must be present at j-th index in the sorted array.
